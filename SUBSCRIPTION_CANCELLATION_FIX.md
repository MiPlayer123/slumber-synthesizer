# Subscription Cancellation Bug Fix

## Problem

When a user cancels their subscription through the Stripe portal, there are issues with how the cancellation state is handled:

1. Stripe marks the subscription as `canceled` status, but the subscription should show as `canceling` until the paid period ends
2. The `cancel_at_period_end` flag is not always set to `true` for canceled subscriptions
3. The `current_period_end` field is sometimes NULL in the database, causing incorrect UI display
4. The UI shows the free tier view instead of the premium view with a cancellation notice
5. The badge styling is too solid and doesn't match the design

When canceling a subscription, these console logs appear:
```
use-subscription.ts:211 Subscription status checked with Stripe: canceled
use-subscription.ts:471 Post-Stripe portal refresh: Subscription status checked with Stripe: canceled
```

After cancellation, the page incorrectly displays the free version UI. It should instead show:
1. The premium version UI
2. A yellow "Canceling" label with semi-transparent styling
3. A "Renew" button
4. Current period end date showing when the subscription will end

## Root Cause

The root causes of this issue are:

1. Stripe marks subscriptions as `canceled` immediately after cancellation, even though the paid period is still active
2. Our code wasn't correctly handling the difference between a subscription that's completely canceled vs. one that's in the "canceling" state (active but will not renew)
3. The `cancel_at_period_end` flag wasn't being properly set to `true` when a user canceled
4. The `current_period_end` field was sometimes not being populated in the database
5. Badge styling was solid instead of semi-transparent with a border

## Fix Implementation

We've implemented the following fixes:

### 1. SQL Update Scripts

Created two scripts to fix existing subscriptions in the database:

#### `update_canceled_subscriptions.sql`
- Sets `subscription_status = 'active'` and `cancel_at_period_end = true` for canceled subscriptions with future end dates
- Sets `cancel_at_period_end = true` for any subscription with `canceled_at` set but `cancel_at_period_end = false`

#### `fix_subscription_periods.sql`
- Identifies subscriptions with NULL `current_period_end` values
- Sets appropriate end dates based on subscription creation or cancellation date
- Ensures all subscriptions have a valid period end date

### 2. Stripe Webhook Handler Updates

Modified the Stripe webhook handler (`stripe-webhook/index.ts`) to:
- Check if a subscription marked as "canceled" still has a future `current_period_end`
- If so, store it as 'active' with `cancel_at_period_end = true`
- Added robust handling to ensure `current_period_end` is always populated
- Added fallback to fetch subscription details directly from Stripe if needed

### 3. get-subscription Edge Function Updates

Modified the `get-subscription` Edge Function to:
- Properly handle "canceled" subscriptions that are still in their paid period
- Set `cancel_at_period_end = true` in these cases
- Added logic to ensure `current_period_end` is always populated
- Re-fetches subscription from Stripe if period end date is missing

### 4. UI Updates

#### Badge Styling
- Updated the "Active" and "Canceling" badges to use semi-transparent backgrounds
- Added borders to match the design in the image
- Changed the "Canceling" badge from solid yellow to semi-transparent amber with border

#### Progress Bar
- Updated progress bar to use semi-transparent colors that match the badges
- Ensures a consistent visual design between badges and progress indicators

### 5. use-subscription.ts Updates

Updated the client-side hook to:
- Detect when a subscription has status "canceled" but is still in its paid period
- Set it as active with `displayStatus = "canceling"` 
- Ensure `cancelAtPeriodEnd = true` is set correctly
- Update the console log text to properly show "canceling" instead of "canceled"

## Testing the Fix

To test this fix:
1. Run the `fix_subscription_cancellations.sh` script to deploy the updated edge functions and fix subscription data
2. Verify that canceled subscriptions in their paid period show the premium UI with a semi-transparent amber "Canceling" badge
3. Check that `cancel_at_period_end` is `true` for these subscriptions
4. Confirm that all subscriptions have a valid `current_period_end` date
5. Test the cancellation flow through the Stripe portal to ensure new cancellations show correctly

## Why This Approach Works

Stripe considers a subscription fully canceled immediately after cancellation, but in our app, we need to differentiate between:
- A subscription that's canceled and the paid period has ended (free tier)
- A subscription that's canceled but the paid period is still active (premium with "canceling" label)

This fix ensures we properly interpret Stripe's status, populate all necessary date fields, and handle it correctly in our UI with matching visual styling.
